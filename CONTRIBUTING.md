# Contributing

To build and test the code in this repository:

```sh
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

The test suite in particular needs a great deal of work, both in terms of
adding tests, and in documenting procedures for measuring coverage.

## TODO

* Define contributor license agreement and signature process.
